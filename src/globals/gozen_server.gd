#------------------------------------------------ STATUS INDICATOR
# TODO: DisplayServer.create_status_indicator()
# Give the status indicator quick shortcuts to start rendering and to see
# rendering progress. Other then that we could have a save button, but not yet
# an idea for any other things so this will require a bit more research. There
# has to be a function to disable the status indicator.


#------------------------------------------------ ICON CHANGER
# TODO: DisplayServer.set_icon() # Could be good to indicate if rendering or not
# This could be helpful for people with non tiling window managers, mainly to
# indicate if is charging or not. There should be a setting to disable this
# icon changer.
